    <p class="event pl-1">
    We don't really need much in the form of house gifts, but we figured that
    we could ask you to help make our honeymoon unforgettable.

    We found <a href="https://www.honeyfund.com/site/rios-velasquez-05-02-2025"
                target="_blank">Honeyfund</a> so that we can give you a glimpse
              of what we want to do for our honeymoon with the funds we receive
              from the wedding. Honeyfund does take a minor portion (~3%), so
              if you want us to use your whole gift, you can Zelle us at one of
              our phone numbers.
