Loren feeling embarrassed to down a burrito by herself, would often complain to Hector that he didn’t eat burritos. Despite what Loren might say, the truth is that I was already prepared for Tacos — i was ready to live Mas. This burrito deprivation would continuously bring up the same allegations, eventually resulting in fake news such as “Hector doesn’t eat burritos.” </p><p class="mt-2"> One day early in the relationship, I said something to the effect of, “I don’t just eat burritos around people I date. I eat burritos with someone I’m going to marry.” But given our sense of humor, Loren just brushed it aside. The thing that Loren didn’t believe was that I frequently ate burritos, just not around her. </p><p class="mt-2"> Fast-forward several years, several flights, a few off-again-on-again periods, a pandemic, more time, crossing the pond twice, and then some. Next came time to propose. I had a few requirements in mind for how to propose, but by far the most important were two requirements: </p><p class="indent-8"> 1. Echo should be around to witness the whole thing </p><p class="indent-8"> 2. It should capture what we’re all about. </p><p class="mt-2"> I had brought the ring with me to several places, hoping that the vibe would be right. This included on our way to dog parks, to our favorite spots nearby, but the moment never quite felt right. </p><p class="mt-2"> After a while of not proposing, the perfect proposal for our relationship hit me! I was craving Mexican food — more specifically a burrito. Remembering that I couldn’t eat a burrito around Loren, it clicked! Propose with a burrito -- she&#39;s know what it means. I ordered a burrito-shaped pencil holder from Amazon and hence started operation Decoy Burrito. </p><p class="mt-2"> One day when we were both hungry &amp; working from home, I decided to buy us &quot;tacos&quot; for lunch. When I got home, I handed Loren a wrapped burrito, and then I proceeded to bite into my unwrapped burrito. Loren didn’t register what was going on, so I asked her if she wanted a bite from my burrito. </p><p class="mt-2"> It was then that she realized that something was different. I told her that I got her a burrito and handed her a wrapped &quot;burrito&quot;. So when she unwrapped her decoy burrito, she saw an engagement ring and her fiance kneeling just behind it. Echo came and placed her head on my non-kneeling knee, and watched as both of her parents happily stumbled over a bunch of words they can’t remember. </p><div class="md:col-span-3 mt-3"><img class="rounded" alt="decoy burrito" src="'+r+'"></div></div>',3))}const h=t(a,[["render",n]]);export{h as default};
